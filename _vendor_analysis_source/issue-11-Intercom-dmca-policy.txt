## Intercom DMCA Policy
Effective day 15 June 2024
If you believe that your copyrighted work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement and is made available via Intercom’s Service or web properties, please notify Intercom’s copyright agent, pursuant to the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (“DMCA”). As part of our response, we may remove or disable access to allegedly infringing material residing on Intercom’s web properties. Please note that Intercom does not own or control third party websites, including websites operated by our customers (“Customers”). Therefore, Intercom cannot necessarily remove content from the websites of its Customers or control what they transmit using our Service.
For your complaint to be valid under the DMCA, you’ll need to provide the following information in writing:
  * An electronic or physical signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyrighted work owner;
  * Identification and description of the copyrighted work, including the URL where this infringing content is available and/or a copy of the copyrighted work;
  * Identification of the material claimed to be infringing and where it is located on Intercom’s Service;
  * Contact details of the person submitting the notice, including an email address, telephone number, and mailing address;
  * A statement in "good faith belief" that the work is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or law; and
  * A statement, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the owner.


The above information must be submitted to the following DMCA Agent:
Attn: DMCA Notice Intercom, Inc. 55 2nd Street, 4th Floor San Francisco, CA 94105
Email: legal@intercom.io
Please note that upon receipt of notice alleging content has infringed on anyone else’s copyrighted content, Intercom will contact the alleged infringer and request them to delete or modify the content specified in the notice. If the changes haven’t been made, and to the extent Intercom has control, Intercom will remove or disable the allegedly infringing content. If you believe your content has been disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification, you may send us a counter notice meeting the requirements listed above that we will pass back to the original copyright owner.
If you believe that your copyright is being infringed by a Customer of Intercom, we strongly encourage you to contact the Customer directly. Intercom can only remove or disable allegedly infringing content associated with a Customer to the extent the content is published or controlled by Intercom. We will make commercially reasonable efforts to notify the affected Customer, and provide the Customer with a copy of the DMCA notification. We may suspend or terminate access to the Service of Customers that repeatedly or egregiously infringe the copyrights of others.
If the copyright owner wishes to keep the content in question disabled after receiving a counter notice, they’ll need to initiate legal action and seek a court order to restrain the user from publishing or transmitting infringing content on Intercom’s Service. If Intercom doesn’t receive the notice within 10-14 days, Intercom will re-enable the disabled content.
UNDER FEDERAL LAW, IF YOU KNOWINGLY MISREPRESENT THAT ONLINE MATERIAL IS INFRINGING, YOU MAY BE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL PROSECUTION FOR PERJURY AND CIVIL PENALTIES, INCLUDING MONETARY DAMAGES, COURT COSTS, AND ATTORNEYS’ FEES.
