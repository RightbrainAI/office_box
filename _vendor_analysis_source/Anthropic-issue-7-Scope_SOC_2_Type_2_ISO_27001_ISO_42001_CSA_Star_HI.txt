FAQ
[View all 24 FAQs](https://trust.anthropic.com/faq)
Will you be using our Claude for Work conversations to train your generative models?
No. By default, we will not use your chats or coding sessions when using our Commercial products (Claude for Work, Anthropic API, etc.).

If you provide feedback or otherwise explicitly opt-in to training, then we may use those materials to train our models. Learn more about disabling feedback for your Claude for Enterprise plan [here](https://privacy.anthropic.com/en/articles/7996868-is-my-data-used-for-model-training).

Is Anthropic willing to sign a BAA?
After review of HIPAA-related compliance items and the customer's use case, Anthropic may provide a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) covering use of our first-party API.

Our BAA only covers our API products, and is only available for customers who qualify for [zero retention](https://privacy.anthropic.com/en/articles/8956058-i-have-a-zero-retention-agreement-with-anthropic-what-products-does-it-apply-to). Our BAA does not cover beta products or chat products, including Workbench and [Claude.ai](http://claude.ai/) (Free, Pro, Team and Enterprise plans), so even if you have a BAA with us for other product surfaces, you should not submit PHI through any product other than GA API products.

See our [Help Center](https://privacy.anthropic.com/en/articles/8114513-will-anthropic-sign-a-business-associate-agreement-baa-and-if-so-for-which-products) for more information.
