## 11. COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL DATA OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
### 11.1 SCOPE
Except as otherwise provided, this Section 11 applies only if you are a California resident. For purposes of this section, "Personal Information" has the meaning given in the California Consumer Privacy Act ("**CCPA** "), the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 ("**CPRA** "), and any regulations promulgated under either law, in each case, as amended from time to time.
This Section 11 does not apply to;
  * information exempted from the scope of the CCPA;
  * activities governed by a different privacy notice, such as notices we give to California personnel or job candidates; or
  * Personal Information we collect, use, and share on behalf of our customers as a "**service provider** " under the CCPA.


### 11.2 YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
You have the following rights:
  * **Right to Information/Know** You can request whether we have collected your Personal Information, and in certain cases, the following information about how we have collected and used your Personal Information during the past 12 months: 
    * The categories of Personal Information we have collected.
    * The categories of sources from which we collected the Personal Information.
    * The business or commercial purpose for collecting, sharing, and/or selling Personal Information.
    * The categories of Personal Information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose.
    * The categories of third parties to whom Personal Information was sold, shared, or disclosed for a business purpose.
  * **Right to Access**. You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you during the past 12 months.
  * **Right to Correction**. You can request that we correct inaccurate Personal Information that we have collected about you.
  * **Right to Deletion**. You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.
  * **Right to Opt-Out of Tracking for Targeted Advertising Purposes**. While we do not sell Personal Information for money, like many companies, we use services that help deliver targeted ads (also known as interest-based ads) to you, as we have described in the “How and Why We Use Your Personal Data” section above. The CCPA classifies our use of some of these services as “sharing” your Personal Information with the advertising partners that provide the services, from which you have the right to opt-out.
  * **Right to Nondiscrimination**. You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination prohibited by the CCPA.


### 11.3 HOW TO EXERCISE YOUR RIGHTS
  * **Right to Information/Know, Access, Correction, and Deletion**. You can exercise any of these rights by submitting a request through our [Privacy Request Form](https://www.intercom.com/privacy-form) or by mailing us at 55 2nd Street, 4th Fl., San Francisco, CA 94105, USA, Attention: Compliance.
  * **Right to Opt-Out of Tracking for Targeted Advertising Purposes**. You can submit requests to opt-out of tracking for targeted advertising purposes by using the cookie preference manager accessible through the “Your Privacy Choices” link in the website’s footer. Your request to opt-out will apply only to the domain, browser and the device from which you submit the request.


**Verification of Identity**. We will need to verify your identity to process your information/know, access, correction, and deletion requests and reserve the right to confirm your California residency. To verify your identity, we may require you to log into an Intercom online account (if applicable), provide government identification, give a declaration as to your identity under penalty of perjury, and/or provide additional information. These rights are not absolute, and in some instances, we may decline your request as permitted by law.
**Authorized Agents**. Your authorized agent may make a request on your behalf upon our verification of the agent's identity and our receipt of a copy of the valid power of attorney given to your authorized agent pursuant to California Probate Code Sections 4000-4465. If you have not provided your agent with such a power of attorney, you must provide your agent with written and signed permission to exercise your CCPA rights on your behalf, provide the information we request to verify your identity and provide us with written confirmation that you have given the authorized agent permission to submit the request.
### 11.4 PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT, USE AND DISCLOSE
