Security
What is ISO 27001?
ISO 27001 is an international standard for information security management systems. It provides requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an organization's information security management.

What can customers assume about Anthropic based on this ISO 27001 certificate?
Customers can have confidence that Anthropic takes a proactive, structured approach to information security. ISO 27001 certification validates that we have implemented a comprehensive information security management system to protect our own and our customers' information assets. 

Refer to our published Statement of Applicability on the Trust Portal for the full list of controls in scope for this ISO standard.

Data Processing
What security measures are in place to protect customer data?
Anthropic has a comprehensive set of security measures in place to protect models and customer data. You can review our externally committed security controls (as a part of our SOC 2 certification) at our Trust Center: https://trust.anthropic.com/controls. All data that Anthropic stores is encrypted at rest using AES-256 GCM, and protected in transit using TLS 1.2+. Our Trust Center has additional information about our security practice.

Where are your data centers located?
For more information, please view this post.

How long is data retained?
By default, Anthropic retains all Customer Data within the Claude for Work platform until the data is deleted by the customer. After deletion, we may retain for up to 30 days in our systems. Prompts/responses that have been flagged as violating our Acceptable Use Policy may be retained longer.

Can we have our own environment, meaning our data is not stored alongside any other customer?
Anthropic uses a multi-tenant architecture for serving responses from our inference model to customer-provided prompts. We do not offer single-tenancy. However, while the physical systems hosting the inference model are shared, all customer data is logically separated to protect its confidentiality and integrity.
