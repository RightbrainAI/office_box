## Regional Data Hosting Addendum
Effective day 8 March 2024
  1. Scope
    1. This Intercom Regional Data Hosting Addendum (“**RDH Addendum** ”) is entered into by and between Intercom R&D Unlimited Company, an Irish company with offices at 124 St Stephen's Green, Dublin 2, DC02 C628, Republic of Ireland ("**Intercom** " “**us** ” or “**we** ”) and the entity or person placing an order via an applicable Order Form for or accessing any Regional Data Hosting services ("**Customer** " or "**you** ") either in the EU or Australia. “**RDH Services** ” are defined as the European or Australian Data Hosting features and services set forth in this RDH Addendum. In order to use RDH Services, you must agree to the RDH Addendum. 
    2. You may use RDH Services only upon approval by Intercom. The Intercom Terms of Service (<https://www.intercom.com/legal/terms-and-policies>) (“**ToS** ”) or, as applicable, Intercom Master Saas Subscription Agreement (“**MSSA** ”) you entered into with Intercom (the “Agreement”) are incorporated by reference and form a part of the Agreement. 
    3. By agreeing to the RDH Addendum you agree that the Intercom Data Processing Addendum (<https://www.intercom.com/legal/data-processing-agreement>) or any signed version of a data processing agreement between Intercom and You (“DPA”), is amended in accordance with Exhibit A or Exhibit B (as applicable) of the RDH Terms. 
    4. All capitalized terms not defined in the RDH Addendum have the meanings set forth in the Agreement. 
    5. Unless stated otherwise, in the event of a conflict between this RDH Addendum, including any attachments herein, and any other applicable terms including the Agreement, the provisions of this RDH Addendum will control but only with respect to the subject matter hereof. 
  2. RDH Services
    1. By agreeing to and complying with the RDH Addendum, we grant you access to the RDH Services (as set out herein) in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. 
    2. Description of the RDH Services: 
      1. An RDH workspace is a stand-alone instance of Intercom.
      2. In an RDH workspace, the Customer Data associated with that workspace will be hosted (as applicable) in either: a datacenter located in the EU or Australia (the “Designated Region”). This includes: 
        1. All visitor and contact data collected by the Messenger for an RDH workspace; 
        2. All the conversation data that happens via the Messenger for a RDH workspace; 
        3. All the data attributes or events a Customer collects on their RDH workspace. 
    3. Notwithstanding Section 2.2 of the RDH Addendum, there are limited circumstances where Customer Data will continue to be transferred and processed outside the Designated Region in accordance with the terms of the DPA and in accordance with Applicable Data Protection Legislation, as follows: 
      1. **Account Administration** : The Intercom Customer’s name, email, credit card data. We require this for processing in our US-based billing systems. 
      2. **Customer Support** : As per our Support Policy, Support is provided 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Intercom has a globally distributed team that provides this level of coverage. 
        1. For European hosted workspaces: The main customer support team is based in the EU and the majority of support issues arising during normal EU business hours (Monday-Friday 9am to 6pm Irish Standard Time) are responded to and resolved by EU-based employees. 
        2. For Australia hosted workspaces: The main customer support team is based in Australia and the majority of support issues arising during normal Australian business hours (Monday-Friday 8am to 5pm AEST or AEDT as applicable) are responded to and resolved by Australia-based employees. 
        3. A support issue may initially be responded to by a member of the customer support team outside of the Designated Region’s business hours. If the customer support team member based outside of the Designated Region cannot resolve the issue without accessing the Customer’s workspace, it will be escalated to the appropriate regionally based team member for resolution during normal EU or Australia business hours. 
        4. If the support issue is urgent and requires resolution outside of the business hours specified in 2.3.2 (a) or (b) as applicable, then a Permitted User of the Customer can grant impersonation access to an Intercom customer support team member based outside the Designated Region. Once granted, access is limited to the specific issue only and access to any Customer Data as part of the impersonation support is limited to the amount and type of Customer Data required to achieve resolution of the issue. Intercom uses state-of-the-art encryption to protect Customer Data at rest and in transit. Intercom uses just-in-time (JIT) access approvals which are granted only for as long as is necessary to resolve the customer support incident. Intercom also relies on role-based access control (RBAC), where individual access is subject to strict requirements, such as the need-to-know principle. 
      3. **Customer initiated transfers as part of Services functionality** : Customer authorizes Intercom to transfer Customer Data outside the Designated Region in order to provide certain Intercom Services’ features selected for use by the Customer. Details of features requiring subprocessing outside of the designated region are specified in the Regional Data Subprocessing List for the Designated Region (<https://www.intercom.com/legal/subprocessors-list>). 
    4. The following Services’ features will not be supported for RDH: <https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/5778275-additional-details-on-intercom-regional-data-hosting>. Please note that over time, this list may change.
