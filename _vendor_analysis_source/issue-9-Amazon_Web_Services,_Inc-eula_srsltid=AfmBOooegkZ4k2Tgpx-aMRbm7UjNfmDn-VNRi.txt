Updated September, 2025
______________________________
This End User License Agreement (“License Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you as the user (“User”) and Maxon or one of its affiliates (“Licensor”). By accepting this License Agreement during the registration process and/or by downloading, installing, reproducing, or otherwise using the software provided by Licensor (“Software”), the User enters into this License Agreement, and this License Agreement governs the User’s use of the Software, associated media and internet-based services. Licensor under this License Agreement is Maxon Computer GmbH, if a product under the Cinema 4D brand, under the Cineware brand or, under the Cinebench brand is licensed. Licensor under this License Agreement is Maxon Computer Inc., if a product under the Redshift brand, under the Red Giant brand, under the Universe brand or under the ZBrush brand is licensed. The ZBrush Software refers to ZBrush operating on desktop and/or ZBrush operating on iPad. The Maxon One Software combines subcomponents that are branded under Cinema 4D, Universe, Redshift, Red Giant, and ZBrush, and the Licensor of each subcomponent differs depending on the brand. The use of the Software without the conclusion of this License Agreement is an infringement of copyright.
§ 1 Object of Agreement
**1.1** The Licensor is entitled to provide the Software to the User and to grant rights to use the Software under this License Agreement. The Licensor retains all intellectual property rights in the Software, and this License Agreement provides for a limited license for the Software, but not for a sale or transfer of the Licensor’s intellectual property rights.
**1.2** If the User is accessing the Software on behalf of a legal entity or another natural person, then User is agreeing to this License Agreement for that legal entity or other natural person, and User represents that User is authorized to act on behalf of such legal entity or other natural person and to bind such legal entity or other natural person to this License Agreement.
**1.3** The Licensor primarily supplies the Software to the User by making the Software available for download on the Internet. The Software may be made available for installation and use on a device or made available via cloud or web-based services.
**1.4** The Licensor licenses the Software with different license models. With the transfer of the Software, the applicable license model, the term of the license and the amount of the license fee are determined. This License Agreement regulates which right of use the User acquires with the respective license model and which general rights and obligations the User has.
**1.5** In order to use the Software, the User must register with the Licensor and from time to time connect to the Internet in order to verify the licensing of the Software.
**1.6** Licensor‘s offer and this license agreement are not addressed to consumers with ordinary residence in Germany. Licensor may therefore require the User to provide Licensor with sufficient proof of Users entrepreneurial status before concluding the contract, e.g. by providing your VAT ID number or other suitable proof. The data required for the proof must be provided by the User completely and truthfully.
**1.7** The Licensor will not provide maintenance and support of the Software under this License Agreement, unless otherwise specified in the respective license model.
**1.8** The Licensor may, at its sole discretion, provide documentation for the Software in electronic form to the User, whereas the Licensor retains all intellectual property rights in the documentation.

If the Perpetual License had been transferred from another previously licensed version, the User may install and use each version, but not concurrently.

Unless otherwise explicitly agreed in writing, this Perpetual License shall not include upgrades, maintenance and support.

The User may use the Command Line Render Client to render 3D computer graphics and the User is also permitted to render animations that the User has created for himself or for third parties, to process the data of third parties, that are not commercial rendering services. To use the Command Line Render Client in the (in-house) render farm, a third-party control software is required, which is not part of the Software.

The User only has a claim against the Licensor for the provision of updates and upgrades if the applicable license model expressly provides this.
**11.4** The Licensor reserves the right to enter limited maintenance mode for certain Software by written announcement on the Licensor's website (“Limited Maintenance Mode”). Limited Maintenance Mode means that the Licensor will no longer release new enhancements (upgrades and updates) of the Software.
