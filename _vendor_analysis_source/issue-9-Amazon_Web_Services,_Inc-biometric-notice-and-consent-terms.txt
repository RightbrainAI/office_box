# Biometric Notice and Consent Terms
## Last Updated: November 14, 2024
These terms and conditions govern your access to and use of Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Chime SDK speaker search, Amazon Connect Voice ID, and Amazon One Enterprise Services. These additional terms supplement the terms and conditions contained in the AWS Customer Agreement or other agreement with us governing your use of the Services (the “Agreement”), and the AWS Service Terms.
If your use of any of these Services is subject to legal requirements related to the collection, possession, processing, use, disclosure, storage, or deletion (collectively “processing”) of any biometric information or identifiers (“biometric data”), including without limitation requirements under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (“BIPA”), the Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act (“CUBI”), the Washington Biometric Identifier statute, the California Consumer Privacy Act, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or any other laws governing biometric data, then you must comply with all such legal requirements, including providing legally adequate notices to all relevant data subjects (including your End Users) informing them of such processing, obtaining from them any necessary consents (including informed written consent and explicit consent, where required) for such processing, and instructing AWS (through the means specified by AWS) to delete their biometric data when required by law. Any notices you provide, and any consents you obtain, must be provided and obtained on behalf of you and on behalf of AWS (identified as your service provider). Sample notice-and-consent language is available [here](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/faqs/).
If you do not comply with these requirements or otherwise fail to comply with all applicable laws, you may not use that Service. You agree to cooperate with AWS to confirm your compliance with all applicable laws and these requirements upon AWS’s request, including by providing AWS with verification that you have obtained any required consents from data subjects. You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless AWS, our affiliates and licensors, and each of their respective employees, officers, directors, and representatives from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, penalties, fines, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in any way related to any third-party claim concerning your direct or indirect failure to meet the requirements of this section or comply with applicable laws.
