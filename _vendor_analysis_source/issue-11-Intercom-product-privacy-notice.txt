## Product Privacy Notice
Effective day 10 September 2025
This Product Privacy Notice (“**Notice** ”) provides information about how Cookies and similar web technologies (further described below) are used within the Services offered by Intercom R&D Unlimited Company, Intercom, Inc., Intercom Software UK Limited, Intercom Software Australia Pty Ltd, and Intercom's group companies ("**Intercom** ", "**we** ", "**us** ", "**our** ") when we handle personal data as a service provider to our Customers in accordance with our Agreements with them. For the purposes of this Notice, “Customers”, “Services”, and other capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Notice have the meanings given to them in the relevant subscription agreement between Intercom and Customer (i.e., [Intercom Terms of Service](https://www.intercom.com/legal/terms-and-policies) or Master SaaS Subscription Agreement) (“**Agreement(s)** ”).
**What are Cookies and similar technologies?**
  * **Cookies** in general are text files stored on a visitor’s device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser for certain purposes.
  * **Browser web storage,** also known as locally stored objects, functions like cookies but enables the storage of a larger amount of data.


These terms we refer to herein collectively as “**Cookies** ”.
## **Intercom Messenger**
The [Intercom Messenger](https://www.intercom.com/messenger) uses the following specific Cookies to support its functionality and the provision of our Services. These cookies are set when an end user visits a Customer web page that has Messenger integrated:
Cookie name | Purpose | Cookie storage duration after visit | Who serves the Cookie  
---|---|---|---  
Cookie: Intercom-id-[app_id] | Identifies visitors to a website or application where the Intercom JavaScript snippet is installed to associate them with Messenger conversations. The cookie is set by default regardless of whether a visitor has interacted with the Messenger and persists after interaction. | 9 months | Intercom  
Cookie: Intercom-session-[app_id] | Allows logged-in end users to maintain access to their past conversations even on pages where logged-in requests are not being sent. | 1 week | Intercom  
Cookie: intercom-device-id-[app_id] | Identifies each unique device that interacts with the Messenger for security purposes. | 9 months | Intercom  
Local storage: intercom.intercom-state-[app_id] | When Customers choose to enable the Intercom Messenger, browser web storage is used to cache the Messenger application data and visitor data so that the Messenger loads sufficiently following a page transition. | Perpetual | Intercom  
**Intercom Help Center**
The [Intercom Help Center](https://www.intercom.com/drlp/articles?utm_source=google&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=16397789190&utm_term=intercom%20help%20center&utm_ad_collection=130765731261&_bt=679237105841&_bg=130765731261&utm_ad=679237105841&offer=articleslp&utm_campaign_name=go_b_pm_acq_core_demo_kw-e_pros_support_alls_alld_namer_us_en&utm_ad_collection_name=us_support_knowledge-base&utm_ad_name=articleslp_rsa_24Q4&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwuJ2xBhA3EiwAMVjkVNLsmkvpjv7eCVwWtVU4mizpvU9RY6J022L9OIUDW5t_JNZ2T1wtpxoCpD0QAvD_BwE) product uses the following specific Cookies to support its functionality and the provision of our Services. These Cookies are set when an end user visits the Customer Help Center:
Cookie name | Purpose | Cookie storage duration after visit | Who serves the Cookie  
---|---|---|---  
Cookie: Intercom-id-[app_id] | Identifies visitors to a website or application where Help Center is installed to associate them with Help Center sessions. | 9 months | Intercom  
Cookie: Intercom-session-[app_id] | Allows logged-in end users to record their reactions to Help Center articles, access restricted Help Center articles, and access their tickets. | 1 week | Intercom  
Local storage: intercom.intercom-state-[app_id] | Browser web storage is used to cache the Messenger application data and visitor data so that the Messenger loads sufficiently following a page transition. | Perpetual | Intercom  
**Notices when Using Intercom Products**
Intercom has access to user data, conversation data and user interaction data and may process it to the extent outlined in our Agreement, and this Product Privacy Notice. This means we may record and process conversations between Customers and end users as necessary to provide our services.
Customers are responsible for providing any legally required notice and obtaining consent from end users in accordance with Applicable Data Protection Legislation, including for the recording of communications where required by law (such as under the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA)).
**Messenger** : Intercom automatically sets cookies. For information on how to enable or disable Intercom Messenger Cookies based on user consent, please see [this article](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/316-the-intercom-messenger-in-your-product-and-on-your-website#h_465dc16720) in our Help Center.
**Help Center** : Intercom automatically sets cookies. If you use the Intercom Help Center, you can add a cookie consent banner to your Help Center and collect any required consent (see [article here](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/12009774-add-a-cookie-consent-banner-to-your-help-center)).
**Third-Party Platforms**
Because Customers can customize their Intercom Services, certain [Third-Party Platforms](https://www.intercom.com/legal/terms-and-policies#third-party-platforms-and-third-party-messaging-apps) may be integrated that collect personal data from their visitors, including through cookies and similar technologies. For example, when Customers embed videos from platforms such as YouTube, Vimeo, Wistia, Loom, JW Player, Microsoft Stream, Brightcove, Synthesia, or guidde into their Help Center, these embedded videos may use cookies and other technologies to function and collect personal data for other purposes. Or if Customers deploy Google Analytics on their Help Center instance, Google may set cookies to operate and collect personal data. For information about how Third-Party Platforms handle personal data and use cookies and other technologies, consult their respective privacy policies and relevant product documentation.
**Visitor Cookie settings**
Most browsers will let Messenger or Help Center visitors reject and clear Cookies in their browser settings. Applicable laws in some jurisdictions may require Customers to inform visitors as to the nature of the Cookies utilized by their Intercom Services, and in certain circumstances, obtain visitors’ prior consent to the placement and/or use of those Cookies. If visitors elect not to activate certain Cookies, certain visitor-facing and Customer-facing features of the Services may not function.
## **Changes to this Notice and questions**
The Cookies and other similar web technologies we use for our Services are subject to change and we may amend this Notice from time to time. If we make material updates to this Notice, we will update the effective date at the top of the Notice and will inform our Customers in advance before the changes take effect.
If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about this Notice, please submit any questions, comments, or concerns using the Contact Us link in the footer of this page.
