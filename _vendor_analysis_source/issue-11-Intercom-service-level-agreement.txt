## Service Level Agreement
Effective day 11 July 2025
This Intercom Service Level Agreement ("SLA") accompanies the Intercom Subscription Terms of Service, available at <https://intercom.com/legal/terms-and-policies> or a successor URL (the "Agreement") entered into between you ("Customer") and Intercom.
  1. **Definitions.** **“AI Agent”** means the Fin AI Agent system “**Core Platform** ” means the Intercom Messenger platforms and Inbox
  2. **Uptime Calculation** AI Agent: Uptime is achieved when Intercom’s AI Agent, Fin, can generate text responses to customer inquiries.
Core Platform: Uptime is achieved when users can successfully engage in key actions such as replying within the Inbox or Messenger platforms.
  3. **Target Availability.** This SLA applies to the Intercom services identified herein, including AI Agent and Core Platform, but does not apply to any separate services that may be identified in the Agreement. Intercom will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the services identified herein available with an uptime of 99.8% of each calendar month ("Target Availability").

AI Agent | 99.8%  
---|---  
Core Platform | 99.8%  
  1. **Exclusions.** The calculation of uptime for the Intercom services identified herein will not include unavailability to the extent due to: (a) use of AI Agent or Core Platform by Customer in a manner not authorized in this Agreement or the applicable Documentation; (b) general Internet problems, force majeure events or other factors outside of Intercom's reasonable control; (c) Customer's equipment, software, network connections or other infrastructure; (d) third party systems, acts or omissions; or (e) Scheduled Maintenance or reasonable emergency maintenance.
  2. **Scheduled Maintenance.** "Scheduled Maintenance" means Intercom's scheduled routine maintenance of the Services for which Intercom notifies Customer at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance. Intercom typically performs Scheduled Maintenance up to three (3) times per year.
  3. **Remedy for Failure to Meet Target Availability.** If there is a verified failure to achieve Target Availability for Customer, on a per service basis, by either AI Agent or Core Platform, in two (2) consecutive months, then Customer may terminate the Service impacted by the failure to meet Target Availability, by sending written notice of termination within thirty (30) days after the end of the second such month, in which case Intercom will refund to Customer any fees Customer has pre-paid (if any) for use of such affected Service for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term. This termination and refund right is Customer's sole and exclusive remedy, and Intercom's sole and exclusive liability, for Intercom's failure to meet the Target Availability.
