## Support Policy for Customers on Essential, Advanced, Expert plans

  * [Intercom Community Forum](https://community.intercom.com/)
  * Intercom Fin AI Agent
  * Human Support
    * On Saturday and Sunday, 'Urgent' requests are prioritized.


**Customer Support First Response Times**
Intercom's Support team aims to provide a target first response to customers in the following time frames. Customers can submit requests with the priority level below; provided Intercom reserves the right to reasonably increase or decrease the priority level at its discretion. We do not promise or guarantee any specific response time.
Request Priority Level | Description | Target First Response Time  
---|---|---  
Urgent | A major feature has stopped working | 1 hour  
Non-Urgent | "I have an issue that's slowing me down" or "I have a general question" | 4 hours  
**Channels**
Customers may contact Intercom for Support via the Intercom Messenger or via email at team@intercom.com.
**Customer Cooperation**
Customers will provide information and cooperation to Intercom as reasonably required for Intercom to provide Support. This includes, without limitation, providing the following information:
  * Aspects of the service that are unavailable or not functioning correctly
  * Impact on customer and/or its end users
  * Event and/or incident time stamps
  * List of steps to reproduce
  * Relevant product URLs, product data, or error messaging
  * Browser console logs, or screenshots (if necessary)
  * Permission for account access (if required for troubleshooting)
  * Available to engage via 'Intercom Phone' to progress troubleshooting when necessary


**Incident Response**
An 'Incident' is when Intercom's hosted services are critically affected for a large number of users with no workaround available (e.g., not responding to requests or serving content). Incidents will be reported on the Intercom Status Page where customers can stay informed of progress. In addition, Intercom's availability policy is described here - [Intercom Service Level Agreement](https://www.intercom.com/legal/service-level-agreement)**.**
**Exclusions**
Intercom will have no obligation to provide Support to the extent the issue arises from: (a) use of the service by customer in an unauthorized manner; (b) general Internet problems, force majeure events or other factors outside of Intercom's reasonable control; (c) customer's equipment, software, network connections or other infrastructure; or (d) third party systems, acts or omissions.
