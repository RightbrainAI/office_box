## Intercom Partner Code of Conduct
Effective day 12 October 2020
**Intercom strives to be a company that lives its values every day.**
Because we are committed to operating with greatest integrity and in compliance with all applicable laws, we also require our merchants, suppliers, distributors, agents, representatives, and other business partners, as well as their employees, agents, representatives, and subcontractors (collectively, **“Partners”**), to share in this commitment.
As such, Intercom will require Partners to agree to abide by all applicable laws, including anti-bribery, anti-harassment, and anti-modern slavery laws, as well as this Partner Code of Conduct (the **“Code”**). Failure to comply with the Code or applicable laws will be considered a breach of the Partner’s contract with Intercom and may result in immediate termination of our business relationship.
## Labor and Employment Laws
_Human Rights, Labor, and Safety Laws_
Intercom respects the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. Intercom is committed to upholding the fundamental human rights of our employees, and we require Partners to adhere to the same high standards. Intercom expects Partners to reject all forms of child, forced, or involuntary labor. Partners must prohibit unlawful discrimination or harassment in its workplaces, which includes any behavior that creates an intimidating, unsafe, or hostile environment, and such prohibition extends to the behavior of Partners’ personnel towards any Intercom personnel or Intercom customer. Partners must further comply with local minimum wage and maximum working hours requirements.
_Equal Opportunity Employment_
It’s our belief that all people are entitled to equal employment opportunities. Partners must assure equal treatment in the administration of all personnel matters from recruitment to compensation and advancement without regard to race, color, creed, sex, gender, religion, marital status, veteran or military status, registered domestic partner status, age, national origin or ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, sexual orientation, taking or requesting statutorily protected leave, or any other consideration made unlawful by federal, state, or local laws (the “Protected Categories”).
_Health and Safety_
Partners must strictly comply with all applicable health and safety laws and regulations applicable in all markets where they operate. This includes a commitment to environmentally sustainable practices and promoting the sustainable use of resources, as well as offering emergency training and resources as appropriate.
## Anti Corruption Laws
Partners may not bribe anyone for any reason, whether in dealings with governments or the private sector. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (**“FCPA”**) and UK Anti Bribery Act (**“Bribery Act”**), and similar laws in other countries, prohibit offering or giving anything of value, directly or indirectly, to government officials or other individuals in order to obtain or retain business. Partners may not make illegal payments to government officials themselves or through a third party. Partners are further forbidden from promising, giving, or authorizing the provision of “facilitating payments” to expedite or secure the performance of a non-discretionary, routine governmental or commercial duties, even if permitted by the FCPA or Bribery Act or other local laws. Under no circumstances may Partners offer, promise, or give gifts, hospitality, and/or travel to government officials on Intercom’s behalf or for the purpose of improperly obtaining or retaining business or securing an improper business advantage.
Conversely, Partners also may not request, agree to accept, or accept a thing of value as a reward or in exchange for improperly performing any activity related to Intercom’s business or if doing so could create or appear to create actual or potential conflicts of interest between Partners and Intercom.
## Competition
Partners must comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding fair competition and antitrust.
## International Trade and Export Controls
Partners must comply with all applicable import, export, customs, sanctions, embargoes, boycott, and other trade compliance laws and regulations.
## Recordkeeping, Financial Integrity, and Honest and Accurate Dealings
Partners' books, records, accounts and financial statements related to business with Intercom must be maintained accurately and with appropriate detail. Partners are required to cooperate fully with Intercom in any government or regulatory audits to the extent relevant and applicable to Partner. Partners must not make any false representations related to any Intercom transaction, including, but not limited to, written or oral misrepresentations of fact or the promotion or use of false documentation such as fraudulent or forged contracts, forged letters of destruction, or any other false or inaccurate records.
## Intellectual Property and Confidential Information
Partners may only use Intercom’s intellectual property, such as trade secret information, copyrights, patents, or trademarks, to the extent and in the manner permitted by Partners’ contract with Intercom. Partners may not infringe the intellectual property rights of others, nor misuse any trade secrets or proprietary or confidential information of Intercom or others for their own purposes or disclose such information to unauthorized third parties. Partners must notify Intercom if they become aware of any unauthorized use of Intercom’s intellectual property or of any unauthorized disclosure of Intercom’s confidential information.
## Raising Issues and Concerns
Intercom encourages and expects Partners to immediately report any violations of laws, rules, regulations, or this Code in connection with Intercom transactions or engagements by sending an email to ethics@intercom.io. We also expect Partners not to retaliate against anyone who, in good faith, reports a violation or suspected violation or assists in an inquiry into such a report.
## Certification and Application
Where Intercom requires, Partners covered by this Code will have their authorized representatives certify that they have read and understood this Code and commit Partners to complying with the Code. Intercom reserves the right to terminate its relationship with any Partners who do not comply with this Code, or upon discovery of noncompliance, do not work in good faith with Intercom to achieve compliance.
