*For Basic and Compliance Pricing Plans, “user verification” means a combination of features marked with “✔️” in the “Detailed Features” section, applied to a single applicant (end-user) – provided that whether Sumsub ID will be applied depends on the applicant's (end-user's) decisions. If the Customer elects not to use all of these features, the user verification will still be charged at full cost.
