You can use the **Copy Applicant** feature to duplicate applicant data across multiple client keys. Once clients agree to share verification data, they become the **donor** and the **recipient**.
Copy Applicant duplicates verification data across client keys without performing additional checks. This process does not qualify as a KYC procedure under most regulatory standards. If regulatory-compliant KYC is required, use the [Reusable KYC](https://docs.sumsub.com/docs/reusable-kyc) service.
The Copy Applicant process involves the following steps:
  1. Donor generates a new share token for a specific applicant. To generate a share token, use [this API method](https://docs.sumsub.com/reference/generate-share-token):


Request example
```
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.sumsub.com/resources/accessTokens/shareToken \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
            {
              "applicantId": "63e092c51b7b4030f2e01154",
              "forClientId": "CoolCoinLtd",
              "ttlInSecs": "600"
            }
      '

```

Name | Type | Required | Description  
---|---|---|---  
`applicantId` | String | Yes | Applicant ID in **donor** company.  
`forClientId` | String | Yes | Client ID for **recipient**. You can find your `clientId` in the Dashboard in the applicant profile (field **Created for**) and in the response (field `clientId`).  
`ttlInSecs` | Integer | No | Time to live in seconds. Default `1200`.  
**Response**
A new share token is returned.

}

```

> ## 📘
> Info
> Make sure your integration code does not validate or analyze the access token content, as the format is not fixed and may undergo further changes in the future. The token must be treated as an arbitrary string with the maximum length of 1KB.
  1. Donor passes the share token to the recipient.
  2. Recipient includes the share token in the request using [this API method](https://docs.sumsub.com/reference/copy-applicant-profile) to import the applicant data.


Request example
```
curl -X POST \
    'https://api.sumsub.com/resources/applicants/-/import?shareToken=_act-0b8a43f6-b70f-4ad3-bda9-7ce904589380'

```

Name | Type | Required | Description  
---|---|---|---  
`shareToken` | String | Yes | Share token generated by **Company A**.  
`resetIdDocSetTypes` | String | No | Specify one or a few comma-separated document types if an applicant has to resubmit the documents. Examples, `SELFIE`, `IDENTITY`, and so on.  
`userId` | String | No | Sets your own `externalUserId` for the imported applicant. In case of an empty value, we will generate a random one.  
`levelName` | String | No | Sets the specified `levelName` to the imported applicant and sets `init` in case not all required documents are present.  
**Response**
A new applicant ID is returned.
Example
```
{
    // Applicant in Company B
    "id": "5d08a63239b79354a2ebaa1d",
    "createdAt": "2019-06-18 10:52:02",
    "clientId": "CoolCoinLtd",
    ...
}

```

> ## ❗️
> Important
> Share tokens are invalidated once used.
Contact our support team at business-support@sumsub.com so that the donor and recipient can each sign a one-time contract to use the service. You will not have to sign any additional documents.
Once the service is enabled, you can add sharing partners directly in the Dashboard. For more instructions, see [this article](https://docs.sumsub.com/docs/manage-sharing-partners).
Implement the share token approach as described above.
