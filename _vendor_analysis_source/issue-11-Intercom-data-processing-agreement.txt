Intercom requires all employees to sign a confidentiality statement at the time of hire.

Intercom will not respond to any Third Party Request, without prior notice to Customer and an opportunity to object, except as legally required to do so or to confirm that such Third Party Request relates to Customer.
#### 7. **Sub-processors.**
i. _Authorization for Sub-processing_. Customer agrees that (a) Intercom may engage Sub-processors as listed at [https://www.intercom.com/legal/subprocessors-list/update](https://www.intercom.com/legal/subprocessors-list) (the "Sub-processor Page") which may be updated from time to time and Intercom Affiliates; and (b) such Affiliates and Sub-processors respectively may engage third party processors to process Customer Personal Data on Intercom's behalf. Customer provides a general authorization for Intercom to engage onward sub-processors that is conditioned on the following requirements: (a) Intercom will restrict the onward sub-processor’s access to Customer Personal Data only to what is strictly necessary to provide the Services and in accordance with the Agreement, and Intercom will prohibit the sub-processor from processing the Customer Personal Data for any other purpose. (b) Intercom agrees to impose contractual data protection obligations, including appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data, on any sub-processor it appoints that require such sub-processor to protect Customer Personal Data to the standard required by Applicable Data Protection Legislation; and (c) Intercom will remain liable and accountable for any breach of this DPA that is caused by an act or omission of its sub-processors.
ii. _Current Sub-processors and Notification of Sub-processor Additions_.
a. Customer understands that effective operation of the Services may require the transfer of Customer Personal Data to Intercom Affiliates, such as Intercom, Inc., or to Intercom's Sub-processors, see Schedule 3. Customer hereby authorizes the transfer of Customer Personal Data to locations outside Europe (Intercom’s primary processing facilities are in the United States of America), including to Intercom Affiliates and Sub-processors, subject to continued compliance with this DPA throughout the duration of the Agreement. Customer hereby provides general authorization to Intercom engaging additional third-party Sub-processors to process Customer Personal Data in accordance with the Agreement.
b. Intercom may, by giving reasonable notice to the Customer, add or replace Sub-processors to the Sub-processor Page. Intercom will notify Customer if it intends to add or replace Sub-processors from the Sub-Processor Page at least twenty (20) days prior to any such changes. To receive such notification, Customers can send an email to dataprotection@intercom.io to join Intercom’s distribution list. If Customer reasonably objects to the appointment of a new Sub-processor within twenty (20) days of receiving such notice, on reasonable grounds relating to the protection of the Customer Personal Data, then Intercom will work in good faith with Customer to find an alternative solution. In the event that the parties are unable to reach a mutually acceptable resolution within a reasonable time thereafter, Customer is permitted to terminate the Agreement.
#### 8. **Impact Assessments and Consultations.** Intercom shall, to the extent required by Applicable Data Protection Legislation, provide Customer with reasonable assistance (at Customer's cost and expense) with data protection impact assessments or prior consultations with data protection authorities that Customer is required to carry out under such legislation.
#### 9. **Security.**
i. Intercom has in place and will maintain throughout the term of this Agreement appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Personal Data against Security Breaches.
ii. These measures shall at a minimum comply with applicable law and include the measures identified in Schedule 2 (Technical and Organizational Security Measures).
iii. Customer acknowledges that the security measures are subject to technical progress and development and that Intercom may update or modify the security measures from time to time, provided that such updates and modifications do not result in the degradation of the overall security of the Services purchased by the Customer.
iv. Intercom will ensure that any person authorized to process Customer Personal Data (including its staff, agents, and subcontractors) shall be subject to a duty of confidentiality.
v. Upon becoming aware of a Security Breach involving Customer Personal Data processed by Intercom on behalf of Customer under this DPA, Intercom shall notify Customer without undue delay and shall provide such information as Customer may reasonably require, including to enable Customer to fulfil its data breach reporting obligations under Applicable Data Protection Legislation.
vi. Intercom’s notification of or response to a Security Breach shall not be construed as an acknowledgement by Intercom of any fault or liability with respect to the Security Breach.
vii. Customer is solely responsible for its use of the Service, including (a) making appropriate use of the Service to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk in respect of Customer Personal Data; (b) securing the account authentication credentials, systems and devices Customer uses to access the Service; and (c) backing up Customer Personal Data.
#### 10. **Return or Deletion of Customer Personal Data.**
Upon termination or expiry of this Agreement, Intercom will (at Customer's election) delete or return to Customer all Customer Personal Data (including copies) in its possession or control. Customer may request to Intercom to delete all Customer Personal Data, and Intercom will proceed to delete the data as soon as reasonably practicable and within a maximum period of 30 days from Customer’s written request. If Customer does not request deletion of Customer Personal Data, Intercom will automatically delete it from our systems 180 days after the termination or expiration of this Agreement. Customer Personal Data from our back-up systems will be deleted after 14 days, save that this requirement will not apply to the extent that Intercom is required by Applicable Data Protection Legislation to retain some or all of the Customer Personal Data, which Intercom will securely isolate and protect from any further processing, except to the extent required by applicable law.
#### 11. **Audits.**
i. The parties acknowledge that when Intercom is acting as a processor on behalf of Customer, Customer must be able to assess Intercom’s compliance with its obligations under Applicable Data Protection Legislation and this DPA.
ii. Upon written request and at no additional cost to Customer, Intercom shall provide Customer, and/or its appropriately qualified third-party representative (collectively, the "Auditor"), access to reasonably requested documentation evidencing Intercom's compliance with its obligations under this DPA in the form of the relevant audits or certifications found at <https://trust.intercom.com>.
iii. While it is the parties’ intention ordinarily to rely on the provision of the documentation to demonstrate Intercom’s compliance with this DPA and the provisions of Article 28 of the GDPR, Intercom shall permit Customer or its Auditor to carry out an audit, at Customer’s cost and expense, (including, without limitation, the costs and expenses of Intercom), of Intercom’s processing of Customer Personal Data under the Agreement upon Customer’s written request for an audit, subject to the terms of this Section. Following Intercom’s receipt of such request, Intercom and Customer shall mutually agree in advance on the details of the audit, including the reasonable start date, scope and duration of any such audit. Any such audit shall be subject to Intercom’s security and confidentiality terms and guidelines, may only be performed a maximum of once annually and will be restricted to only data relevant to Customer. Where the Auditor is a third-party, Intercom may object in writing to such Auditor, if in Intercom's reasonable opinion, the Auditor is not suitably qualified or is a direct competitor of Intercom. Any such objection by Intercom will require Customer to either appoint another Auditor or conduct the audit itself. Any expenses incurred by an Auditor in connection with any review of reports or an audit shall be borne exclusively by the Auditor. For clarity, the exercise of audit rights under the SCCs shall be as described in this Section 11 (Audits)
iv. Intercom uses external auditors to verify the adequacy of its security measures with respect to its processing of Customer Personal Data. A description of Intercom’s certifications and standards for audit can be found at <https://trust.intercom.com>.
#### 12. **Transfer Mechanisms.**
i. Location of Processing. Customer acknowledges that Intercom and its Sub-processors may transfer and process personal data to and in the United States of America and other locations in which Intercom, its Affiliates or its Sub-processors maintain data processing operations, as more particularly described in the Sub-processor Page. Intercom shall ensure that such transfers are made in compliance with Applicable Data Protection Legislation and this DPA.
ii. Transfer Mechanism. The parties agree that when the transfer of personal data from Customer (as “data exporter”) to Intercom (as “data importer”) is a Restricted Transfer, Applicable Data Protection Legislation requires that appropriate safeguards are put in place. For the purposes of such Restricted Transfers from Customer to Intercom, the parties rely on Intercom’s certification under the EU-U.S Data Privacy Framework, the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework and the UK-US Data Privacy Framework (together, the “DPF”) operated by the U.S. Department of Commerce. To the extent that the DPF is invalidated or ceases to be an appropriate safeguard under Article 46 GDPR for transfers to the United States, then, such transfer shall be subject to the appropriate Standard Contractual Clauses, which shall be deemed incorporated into and form part of this DPA, as follows:
a. In relation to transfers of Customer Personal Data that is protected by the GDPR, the EU SCCs shall apply, completed as follows:
  1. Module Two or Module Three will apply (as applicable);

  * <https://www.intercom.com/legal/privacy>


Where applicable, this Schedule 2 will serve as Annex II to the Standard Contractual Clauses. The following table provides more information regarding the technical and organizational security measures set forth below.
Technical and Organizational Security Measure | Evidence of Technical and Organizational Security Measure  
---|---  
Measures of pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data | 
  * All data sent to or from Intercom is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2.
  * Customer Personal Data is encrypted at rest using 256-bit encryption, leveraging AWS' encryption framework’s model C as described in <https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-securing-data-at-rest-with-encryption.pdf>
  * All Intercom datastores used to process Customer data are configured and patched using commercially reasonable methods according to industry-recognized system-hardening standards.
  * See “Encryption” at <https://trust.intercom.com>.

  
Measures for ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services | 
  * Intercom has implemented a formal procedure for handling security events. When security events are detected, they are escalated to an emergency alias, relevant parties are paged, notified, and assembled to rapidly address the event. After a security event is contained and mitigated, relevant teams write up a post-mortem analysis, which is reviewed in person and distributed across the company and includes action items that will make the detection and prevention of a similar event easier in the future.
  * By default, all Customer Data is permanently stored in the USA and is backed up for disaster recovery. However, for those customers who use Intercom’s regional data hosting services in the EU or Australia , their data will be stored and processed in the applicable designated region (i.e., EU or Australia), unless otherwise noted in our [Subprocessor Page](https://www.intercom.com/legal/subprocessors-list/update). In such cases, the [Regional Data Hosting Addendum](https://www.intercom.com/legal/regional-data-hosting-addendum) is incorporated by reference herein and will apply and modify this DPA accordingly.
  * Intercom relies on Amazon Web Services (AWS), a reputable Infrastructure-As-A-Service provider. Intercom leverages their portfolio of globally redundant services to ensure Services run reliably. Intercom benefits from the ability to dynamically scale up, or completely re-provision its infrastructure resources on an as-needed basis, across multiple geographical areas, using the same vendor, tools, and APIs. Intercom’s infrastructure scales up and down on demand as part of day-to-day operations and does so in response to any changes in our customers’ needs. This includes not just compute resources, but storage and database resources, networking, security, and DNS. Every component in Intercom’s infrastructure is designed and built for high availability.
  * Intercom’s data security, high availability, and built-in redundancy are designed to ensure application availability and protect information from accidental loss or destruction. Intercom’s Disaster Recovery plan incorporates geographic failover between its 3 U.S. data centers. Subscription Service restoration is within commercially reasonable efforts and is performed in conjunction with AWS’ ability to provide adequate infrastructure at the prevailing failover location. All of Intercom recovery and resilience mechanisms are tested regularly and processes are updated as required.
  * Intercom operates a dedicated 24x7 on-call incident management function, ready to immediately respond to, and mitigate, any Customer impacting issues. This is supported by Intercom’s broader internal Availability program which is dedicated to ensuring Intercom maintains their system availability.
  * Intercom has no direct reliance on specific office locations to sustain operations. All operational access to production resources can be exercised at any location on the Internet. Intercom leverages a range of best-of- breed technologies and other critical cloud tools to deliver uninterrupted remote work for all employees.
  * All Customer Data deleted by Intercom is deleted from AWS datastores in accordance with the NIST Special Publication 800-88 Revision 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitation December 18, 2014 (available at [http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-88r1.pdf](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-88r1.pdf)). With respect to Customer Data encrypted in compliance with this security policy, this deletion may be done by permanently and securely deleting all copies of the keys used for encryption.
