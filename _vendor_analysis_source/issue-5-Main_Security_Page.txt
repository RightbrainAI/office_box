# Sumsub Trust Center
Setting new standards in compliance, fraud prevention, and verification is only half the story — at the heart of our commitment is complete transparency with our clients about the robust systems, certifications, audits, and policies that back it up. We conduct regular penetration testing and adhere to stringent data privacy regulations, including GDPR and CCPA, to safeguard your information with unwavering diligence. These efforts, combined with our comprehensive security measures, position Sumsub as a globally trusted and secure verification leader, serving industries such as fintech, cryptocurrency, transportation, online marketplaces, and beyond.
To maintain transparency, we’ve established the Sumsub Trust Center—a dedicated hub where clients can independently evaluate our security practices, access restricted documents (like our SOC 2 Type 2 report, AOC of PCI DSS, and more), review our compliance certifications, and gain deeper insight into our protective frameworks.
