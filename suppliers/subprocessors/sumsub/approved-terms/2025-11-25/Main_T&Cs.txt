The Customer is not allowed to resell, sublicense, redistribute, or otherwise make the System and/or the Services (or any materials or results derived therefrom) available to any third party without the Service Provider’s prior written consent (which the Service Provider shall not unreasonably withhold if it is required under applicable laws or regulations or a lawful request by a competent government authority to make the System and/or the Services available to a third party).
**Check** means a subcategory of the Services with the following characteristics: (i) a Check is deemed completed when the Applicant in respect of which it has been conducted is assigned a “Rejected”, “Approved”, or “Resubmission requested” status in the Dashboard; and (ii) if any Check is reiterated in respect of the same Applicant later than one calendar month from the moment when the first such Check was completed or, irrespectively of the timing, by the Customer or at the Customer's request, such reiteration shall be considered a new Check and, therefore, billed separately.
**Commencement Date** means the date on which the Customer (i) expresses its consent to be bound by these Terms and Conditions via the Website; or(ii) starts using or otherwise accesses the System and/or the Services in the absence of a commercial agreement in force between the Parties,(whichever is earlier).

The Customer may at any time enable or disable any of the Services covered by the applicable Pricing Plan via the Dashboard or, if necessary, by contacting the Service Provider at business-support@sumsub.com (for clarity, disabling a Service only results in a reduction of payable Fees if it is explicitly so provided under the respective Pricing Plan). Where the Customer enables a Service not covered by the Pricing Plan applicable to the Customer at the relevant time (other than in accordance with Clause 3.5 of these Terms and Conditions), the Service Provider may, at its sole discretion, (i) transfer the Customer to a Pricing Plan that includes the Service in question, and/or (ii) charge the Customer for its usage of the Service in question as per the Pricing Plan including the said Service, and/or (iii) suspend or limit the Customer’s access to the System and/or the Services.

For the avoidance of doubt, Sumsub ID User Terms and Conditions are hereinafter only linked for reference; they do not constitute part of these Terms and Conditions, are not binding as between the Service Provider and the Customer, and do not create any rights or obligations for the Service Provider or the Customer (or any of their respective affiliate entities) towards each other unless explicitly specified herein.The Customer agrees that the Service Provider (or any of its affiliate entities, as the case may be) may embed an option for the Customer’s Applicants to accede to Sumsub ID User Terms and Conditions and subsequently use Sumsub ID into the System (including the SDK) and, where it in its discretion considers so necessary, modify the System accordingly.
**System** means a set of computer programs and databases owned and/or operated by the Service Provider to render the services described in the Specification (the “**Services** ”), including API and SDK.

1.5 Where figures are referred to in numerals and in words, and there is any conflict between the two, the words shall prevail.
1.6 Where the expressions “include(s)”, “including” or “in particular” are used in these Terms and Conditions, the list of words following them shall not be considered exhaustive unless explicitly indicated otherwise.

## 3. Connection to the System
3.1 The Service Provider shall grant the Customer full access to the System and the Services as purchased under the respective Pricing Plan immediately upon the Billing Start Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing:
3.1.1) a limited scope of the System’s functionalities (not including, in particular, any chargeable Services), determined at the Service Provider’s sole discretion, may become available to the Customer upon the Commencement Date, subject to the Customer following the instructions forwarded by the Service Provider to the email address specified by the Customer via the Website (if applicable). The Customer shall not upload any personal data (except that of the individual uploading it, unless that individual is also an Applicant) into the System before the Billing Start Date. Any output generated by the Service Provider in relation to any data uploaded by the Customer into the System prior to the Billing Start Date is a mere demonstration of the System’s capabilities and may not be regarded as processing similar or equivalent to that constituting the Services;
3.1.2) immediately upon the Commencement Date, as well as upon the beginning of the Trial Period (or, if there is no Trial Period, the moment the Customer starts using the chargeable Services) and thereafter, the Customer shall be obliged, when requested to do so, to submit to the Service Provider certain information about itself as further specified by the Service Provider via the Website, by email or otherwise for due diligence purposes (including, but not limited to, personal details of Authorized Users; billing details as required under the applicable Pricing Plan; company details, ownership and control structure, personal details of ultimate beneficial owners and senior officers, supporting corporate documents; nature of business and any required licenses, registrations, certifications, approvals (if applicable); website address; and other data as may be requested by the Service Provider). The Service Provider may, in its sole discretion, disregard any updates made by the Customer to the previously submitted information, to the extent such updates do not amount to an assignment permitted under clause 11.7 below. The Service Provider shall be entitled, at its sole discretion, to suspend or limit the Customer’s access to the System and/or the Services and/or terminate the Terms and Conditions as between itself and the Customer where (i) the Customer fails to timely provide the requested information (in full or in part); (ii) the information provided by the Customer is false, incomplete, inconsistent, or incorrect; (iii) the Service Provider may not or is recommended not to continue a business relationship with the Customer as per the Service Provider’s due diligence policies and procedures; or (iv) in any other case as may be defined by these Terms and Conditions. The Service Provider shall not be obliged to disclose the scope or results of its due diligence procedures. Where the Service Provider has informed the Customer that its due diligence procedures have rendered a final negative result and has withdrawn the Customer’s access to its account in the System’s production environment, these Terms and Conditions shall be considered terminated with immediate effect; should the access to the same account be subsequently restored, the Terms and Conditions shall be considered to have continued in force, starting from the moment of such restoration, on the same terms as were in effect between the Parties immediately prior to the termination, unless a newer version of these Terms and Conditions has been adopted, in which case the updated version shall apply from its effective date or from the date of restoration, whichever is later.
3.2. On or after the Commencement Date (but not before the Customer indicates its payment method, company details and billing details and activates the chosen Pricing Plan in the Dashboard), the Service Provider may, at its sole discretion, grant the Customer an option to activate a Trial Period, the exact duration and scope of which shall be specified in the Dashboard. The Trial Period may only be activated by the Customer. The Customer acknowledges that not all features and functionalities of the System may be available during the Trial Period. **Upon the expiry of the Trial Period, the Services shall immediately and automatically become chargeable as per the applicable Pricing Plan.**
3.3 For the duration of the Term, the Service Provider shall supply the Customer with (i) Services based on the Pricing Plan applicable at any relevant time and the SLA; (ii) as soon as reasonably practicable, any New Releases; and (iii) technical support, including maintaining the System up-to-date, in good working order, and free from Malicious Code, and restoring it to normal operational conditions if inaccessible.
3.4 The Customer acknowledges that for any reason, at any time, and without prior notice, the Service Provider may issue New Releases, and agrees to implement such New Releases promptly. Failure of the Customer to update its version of the System to the New Release within 60 days of notification from the Service Provider shall, for the avoidance of doubt, be considered a breach as per clause 10.2(i) of these Terms and Conditions. The Service Provider shall not be in any way liable for the System's incorrect operation, unavailability, or any other deficiencies that are due to the Customer's failure to timely comply with its obligations as set out in this clause 3.4.
3.5 The Customer may activate Services not included in its current Pricing Plan (as listed in the Dashboard) by using the Dashboard activation functionality and providing the required consent via the Dashboard. The Service description, Fees, and any service-specific conditions displayed/referenced in the Dashboard at activation govern use of the activated Service and are incorporated into these Terms and Conditions by reference. By providing consent and proceeding with activation, the activating Authorized User represents and warrants that they are duly authorized to bind the Customer to the activation, the Fees, and the conditions applicable to the relevant Service as displayed in the Dashboard. Fees for any Service activated under this clause accrue from activation, are recurring and/or usage-based as indicated in the Dashboard, and shall be billed and payable in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.

4.1 The Customer acknowledges and agrees that all Intellectual Property Rights in the System and the Services belong to the Service Provider or its licensors (as the case may be) and the Customer shall have no rights to or interest in the System and/or Services other than those expressly granted under these Terms and Conditions.

The Customer may convert to another Pricing Plan at any time through the Dashboard or, if necessary, by contacting the Service Provider at business-support@sumsub.com. If, as a result of such conversion, the Commitment payable by the Customer regularly as per Annex 2: (i) increases or remains the same compared to the previous Pricing Plan – the conversion becomes effective immediately, with the Fees payable under the new Pricing Plan in the then-current month recalculated in proportion to the number of days remaining in that month; (ii) decreases compared to the previous Pricing Plan – the conversion becomes effective starting from the first day of the month immediately following the conversion.
5.2 The Service Provider reserves the right, in the event that a specific Pricing Plan chosen by the Customer is discontinued, to convert the Customer to another Pricing Plan that includes substantially the same Services, provided that the Customer is notified no less than **fifteen (15) days** prior to the effective date of such change. The details of the conversion will be outlined in the relevant notice issued by the Service Provider.
5.3 Unless it follows otherwise from Annex 2 or the applicable Pricing Plan, any payable Fees will be automatically withdrawn from the bank account specified by the Customer in the Dashboard as further specified in Annex 2. The Customer shall ensure in advance the availability of sufficient funds on its bank account; where a withdrawal is not successful for any reason, the Service Provider may make multiple repeated attempts, provided that the amount actually withdrawn never exceeds the amount outstanding under these Terms and Conditions. Time of payment will be of the essence.
5.4 The Service Provider shall have the right to suspend or limit the Customer’s access to the Services and/or the System: (i) in case any amounts payable by the Customer are overdue – until all such amounts are received by the Service Provider in full; and (ii) in case any amounts payable by the Customer are due and outstanding (without necessarily being overdue) – as described in Annex 2. Additionally, the Service Provider shall be entitled to claim interest on any overdue sum from the due date until payment of the overdue sum in full, whether before or after judgment. Interest under this clause 5.3 shall be in the amount of 0,1% of the overdue sum per each day of delay.

6.2 The Customer shall not: (i) use Confidential Information in order to build a product or service which competes with the Services; (ii) attempt to copy, modify, duplicate, create derivative works from, frame, mirror, republish, download, display, transmit, or distribute all or any portion of Confidential Information (as applicable) in any form or media or by any means to any individual or entity; or (iii) reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble Confidential Information.
6.3 The Customer shall not be prevented from disclosing Confidential Information to members of personnel or professional advisors (“**Representatives** ”) who need to know it and who have agreed in writing to confidentiality obligations no less restrictive than those contained herein.

The Customer shall remain liable for any act or omission by its Representatives as if they were its own.
6.4 In the event that the Customer or any of its Representatives are requested pursuant to any applicable law or regulation or by legal process to disclose any Confidential Information, the Customer shall give the Service Provider prompt notice of such request or legal process in order to enable the Service Provider: (i) to seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy; or (ii) to consult with the Customer with respect to taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such request or legal process. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the Customer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to disclose only that portion of Confidential Information which is legally required to be disclosed and to require that all Confidential Information that is so disclosed will be accorded confidential treatment.
6.5 If so requested by the Service Provider at any time by written notice to the Customer, the Customer shall promptly: (i) destroy or return to the Service Provider all documents and materials (and any copies thereof) containing, reflecting, incorporating or based on the Confidential Information; (ii) erase all Confidential Information from its computer and communications systems, devices and other means of electronic storage; and (iii) certify in writing to the Service Provider that it has complied with the requirements of this clause 6.5.
6.6 Without affecting any other rights and remedies that the Service Provider may have, the Customer hereby agrees that damages would not be an adequate remedy for any breach of this section 6 by the Customer and that the Service Provider shall be entitled to remedies of injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach of this section 6. The Customer’s liability for any breach of the provisions of this section 6 shall not be subject to any liability limitation otherwise applicable under these Terms and Conditions.

6.10 Where these Terms and Conditions are terminated for any reason (including termination resulting from a final negative outcome of the Service Provider’s due diligence procedures in accordance with clause 3.1.2 herein), the Service Provider shall, (i) subject to the Customer’s written request and unless the Customer is in breach of these Terms and Conditions as of the termination date, enable the Customer to retrieve all personal data related to its Applicants as may be stored at the relevant time in the Customer’s dedicated account in the Dashboard, free of charge, within 30 days following the termination date; and subsequently (ii) delete all such personal data (excluding any data that the Service Provider may be permitted or obliged to retain under these Terms and Conditions or the applicable laws and regulations) from the System in the absence of the Parties’ mutual agreement to the contrary.
6.11 In addition to the foregoing, where the Customer has cancelled its subscription to the applicable Pricing Plan and/or has suspended the provision of the Services by submitting a request via the Dashboard, the Service Provider shall, following a period of one (1) year of continuous inactivity in the Customer’s dedicated account in the Dashboard (in the absence of the Parties’ mutual agreement to the contrary) delete all personal data relating to the Customer’s Applicants stored in such account, excluding any data the Service Provider is permitted or obliged to retain under these Terms and Conditions or applicable laws and regulations.

9.1 The Customer warrants, represents and covenants that: (i) it is duly incorporated, organized and validly existing under the applicable law; (ii) it has good and sufficient capacity, power, authority and right to enter into, execute and deliver these Terms and Conditions, to complete the transactions contemplated hereby and to duly observe and perform the covenants and obligations contained herein; and (iii) all necessary corporate action has been taken by it to authorize and approve the execution and delivery of these Terms and Conditions, the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby and the observance and performance of the covenants and obligations contained herein.
9.2 The Customer shall not: (i) use the System and/or the Services to discriminate against any Applicant or in a manner that causes damage or injury to any person or property or is otherwise incompatible with any applicable law or regulation; (ii) use the System and/or the Services for any purposes other than the Business Purpose; (iii) use the System and/or the Services in a manner that could be reasonably expected to bring the Service Provider into disrepute or otherwise harm its reputation; or (iv) act or omit to act in a way that interferes with or compromises the integrity or security of the System and/or the Services.
9.3 No conditions, warranties or other terms apply to the System and/or any Services supplied by the Service Provider under these Terms and Conditions other than those expressly set forth herein. The Service Provider hereby disclaims any implied warranties whether arising under law, through course of dealing, or otherwise, including any implied warranties of non-infringement, title, satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose, merchantability or conformance with description. In addition, the Service Provider does not warrant or enter into any other term to the effect that the Services or any other technology provided in connection with these Terms and Conditions will be entirely free from defects or errors. The Customer acknowledges that the Services are provided on an “as is” basis. The Services are not intended to be used as the sole basis for any business decision (including where those business decisions concern Applicants). The Customer agrees that the Service Provider has no liability for any inaccuracy, incompleteness or other error in the Services which is attributable to data provided by the Customer or any third party, including cases where the provision of a Service may be limited, suspended or discontinued due to a deficiency and/or unavailability of data submitted by an external third-party source the Service Provider may engage to provide the relevant Service. The Service Provider is not a consumer reporting agency and none of the information provided through the Services constitute a "consumer report" as such term is defined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq). The Services are expressly limited to providing supplemental information in support of the Customer’s anti-fraud, customer due diligence and identity verification procedures only. The Services are based on information that was not collected, in whole or in part, for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing a consumer's eligibility for credit or insurance, being used primarily for personal, family or household purposes, employment, or any other similar purpose.
9.4 **This clause 9.4 shall apply if** : (a) the Service Provider is **SUMSUB TECH LTD** as stated in the section “Parties to these Terms and Conditions” above, and (b) the Customer is **not** incorporated and registered in Cyprus. The Customer hereby represents and warrants that the use and enjoyment of the Services will exclusively take place outside Cyprus (for clarity, the mere fact an Applicant may be a resident of or be located in Cyprus does not constitute a breach of this clause 9.4). The Customer also hereby represents and warrants that it does not have any affiliated organizations, branches, representative offices, permanent establishments (or any other forms of conducting business) in the territory of Cyprus and does not engage in commercial activities using the Services through such forms.

In addition, the Customer may at any time suspend the provision of Services (without prejudice to the effect of the provisions of these Terms and Conditions unaffected by such suspension) by making a request via the Dashboard, such suspension becoming effective on the first day of the month immediately following the month of the request; for clarity, the Services remain chargeable until the suspension becomes effective and shall become chargeable again immediately once the suspension is removed by the Customer or upon the Customer’s request.

10.3 Any provision of these Terms and Conditions that expressly or by implication is intended to come into or continue in force on or after the termination of these Terms and Conditions shall remain in full force and effect. Termination of these Terms and Conditions for any reason shall not affect the accrued rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities of the Parties that may have accrued by the termination date.

In case of suspension, full access to the System and/or the Services may be restored by the Service Provider at its sole discretion and subject to the Customer taking such actions and providing such information as the Service Provider may further determine.
10.5. Where the Service Provider is permitted to suspend or limit the Customer’s access to the System and/or the Services under these Terms and Conditions, it shall be entitled to do so, in all cases in its sole discretion, (i) with immediate effect and with no prior notice; or (ii) in several consecutive steps (e.g., by disabling the Customer's access to the Dashboard and subsequently stopping the provision of Services altogether); or (iii) in any other manner.
## 11. General
11.1 A Party shall not be considered to be in breach of these Terms and Conditions, and shall be excused from performance or liability for damages to the other Party (or any third party), if and to the extent it is delayed in or prevented from performing or carrying out any of the provisions of these Terms and Conditions due to a labor disturbance, sabotage, act of the public enemy, war, invasion, insurrection, riot, fire, storm, flood, earthquake, explosion, epidemic, or any other cause beyond such Party’s reasonable control, including, but not limited to, any curtailment, order, regulation, or restriction imposed by governmental, military or lawfully established civilian authorities, or by making of repairs necessitated by an emergency circumstance not limited to those listed above upon the property or equipment of the Party or property or equipment of others which is deemed under the operational control of the Party (“**Force Majeure** ”). Any Party claiming a Force Majeure event shall use reasonable diligence to remove the condition that prevents performance and shall not be entitled to suspend performance of its obligations in any greater scope or for any longer duration than is required by the Force Majeure event. Each Party shall use its best efforts to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure event, remedy its inability to perform, and resume full performance of its obligations hereunder. Either Party shall be entitled to terminate these Terms and Conditions with immediate effect by giving the other Party written notice if the Force Majeure event remains unremedied for a period of 60 consecutive days.
11.2 The Service Provider may update these Terms and Conditions occasionally from time to time at its sole discretion. The Service Provider shall use reasonable endeavours to notify the Customer of such updates by email and/or via the Dashboard and/or via the Website. **The Customer is solely responsible for ensuring it has read, acknowledged, and agreed to the updated version of these Terms and Conditions. For the avoidance of doubt, the Customer’s continued usage of the System and/or the Services or the fact the Customer had not objected to the updates made to these Terms and Conditions before they became effective shall be regarded as acceptance of the updates.** For clarity and subject to the provision above, in the event of any suspension of the Services and/or the Customer’s access to the Dashboard, and the subsequent lifting of such suspension and/or restoration of access, the version of the Terms and Conditions in effect at the time of such restoration shall govern the Customer’s use of the Services from the date of restoration. By continuing to use the Services following such suspension removal and/or access restoration, the Customer acknowledges and agrees to be bound by the version of the Terms and Conditions in effect at that time.
11.3 Failure or delay of either Party in exercising any right or remedy under these Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such (or any other) right or remedy. The use of any remedy by either Party shall not constitute an election of that remedy to the exclusion of any other right or remedy.
11.4 If any provision of these Terms and Conditions (or part of any provision) is found by any court or other authority of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that provision or part-provision shall, to the extent required, be deemed not to form part of these Terms and Conditions.
11.5 These Terms and Conditions constitute the whole agreement between the Parties and supersede any previous arrangement, understanding or agreement between them relating to the subject matter of these Terms and Conditions (unless expressly agreed otherwise by the Parties). Each Party acknowledges that in entering into these Terms and Conditions, it has not relied upon any oral or written statements, collateral or other warranties, assurances, representations or undertakings which were made by or on behalf of the other Party in relation to the subject matter of these Terms and Conditions other than those which are set out herein (or those which the Terms and Conditions explicitly refer to).
11.6 Except as expressly stated otherwise, nothing in these Terms and Conditions shall create or confer any rights or other benefits in favour of any person other than the Parties. Except as expressly stated otherwise, nothing in these Terms and Conditions shall create an agency, partnership or joint venture of any kind between the Parties. Neither Party shall have authority to act in the name of or on behalf of the other, or to enter into any commitment or make any representation or warranty or otherwise bind the other in any way.
11.7 The Customer may not assign any of its rights or obligations under these Terms and Conditions without the prior written consent of the Service Provider, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. If permitted under the applicable laws and regulations, the Service Provider may assign its rights and/or obligations to one of its affiliates (meaning entities controlled by, controlling, or under common control with the Service Provider) without the Customer’s consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may assign, subject to advance written notice, its rights or obligations under these Terms and Conditions to an acquirer of all or substantially all of the assets of such Party without the consent of the other.
11.8 The Customer is only permitted to make public announcements and/or publish written materials concerning the Service Provider and/or the existence and nature of the business relationship between the Parties subject to the Service Provider’s prior written consent, except as required by law, any governmental or regulatory authority (including, without limitation, any relevant securities exchange), any court or other authority of competent jurisdiction. The Service Provider may freely use the Customer’s trademarks (including logos) in its promotional or marketing materials, on the Website, etc., for the purpose of publicly identifying the Customer as its counterparty.
11.9 Unless specified otherwise in these Terms and Conditions, any notice or communication required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and in English.

The Parties may update their email and physical addresses for notices or communication at any time by notice in writing, or through the Dashboard, or as otherwise provided under this clause 11.9.
11.10 The Parties shall: (i) comply with all applicable laws, statutes and regulations relating to anti-bribery and anti-corruption ; (ii) promptly report to the other Party any request or demand for any undue financial or other advantage of any kind received by it in connection with the performance of these Terms and Conditions.

## 12. Reusable KYC Service
12.1 This сlause 12 sets out the description and functionality of the Reusable KYC Service, together with the terms and conditions applicable to its provision to the Customer.
12.2 Reusable KYC Service enables the Customer to:(i) upon request from a Reusable KYC Recipient, share all or some of the data then-currently stored in the Dashboard profile of a given Customer’s Applicant, to the extent facilitated by the Service Provider at the relevant time, with that Reusable KYC Recipient, thereby acting as a “**Reusable KYC Donor** ”. “**Reusable KYC Recipient** ” shall mean any legal entity with an active Dashboard account (operated as per any binding agreement between either (a) the Customer and the Service Provider (or any of the latter’s affiliates, as the case may be); or (b) the respective legal entity and the Service Provider (or any of the latter’s affiliates, as the case may be)) and authorized access to the Reusable KYC Service or the [Copy Applicant Service](https://docs.sumsub.com/docs/copy-applicant); and (ii) receive, from another Reusable KYC Donor (subject to the latter’s authorization), all or some of the data then-currently stored in the Dashboard profile of a given Applicant of that Reusable KYC Donor, thereby acting as a Reusable KYC Recipient itself;on the following conditions:
  * •any sharing or receiving of data as described above shall only be conducted via the System and between the Dashboard accounts of the Reusable KYC Donor and the Reusable KYC Recipient engaged in the respective transfer;
  * •any data transferred to the Customer acting as a Reusable KYC Recipient shall undergo such Checks and other Services (chargeable separately) as are purchased under these Terms and Conditions and required as per the Customer’s Dashboard settings (if applicable);
  * •for the Customer to be able to share any Applicant data with any Reusable KYC Recipient or receive any Applicant data from any Reusable KYC Donor, the Customer shall, via the Dashboard (or otherwise if the required functionality is not available in the Dashboard at the relevant time), (i) communicate this intention to the respective Reusable KYC Recipient or Reusable KYC Donor (as the case may be) and (ii) obtain their confirmation. By accepting these Terms and Conditions, the Customer agrees to automatically join the network of Reusable KYC Recipients and Reusable KYC Donors available in the Dashboard (as may be facilitated by the Service Provider at the relevant time) and acknowledges every other participant of the said network as eligible to engage in data sharing with the Customer for the purposes of this Service both as a Reusable KYC Recipient and as a Reusable KYC Donor; conditions (i) and (ii) shall be deemed fulfilled in relation to such participants;
  * •the Customer acknowledges that the Service Provider does not in any way guarantee (i) the willingness of any Reusable KYC Donor or Reusable KYC Recipient to transfer Applicant data to or from the Customer; or (ii) the sufficiency or suitability of any Applicant data transferred by or to the Customer for any particular purpose; or (iii) the availability of any specific Applicant data for the Customer’s receipt; or (iv) any other features or characteristics of the Service not explicitly detailed hereunder;
  * •for the purposes of all data processing activities necessary to provide this Service to the Customer, the Service Provider remains a data processor acting in accordance with the Customer’s instructions (as detailed in the DPA). The Customer and any Reusable KYC Donors and/or Reusable KYC Recipients exchanging Applicant data with the Customer for the purposes of this Service shall, in relation to one another, be considered by the Service Provider as independent data controllers (unless the Customer demonstrates the existence of a joint data controller relationship instead, in which case the Customer shall also instruct the Service Provider on how the data controller rights and obligations are allocated between the relevant parties);
  * •the Customer warrants that it has a legal basis, under the applicable data protection laws and regulations, (i) as a Reusable KYC Donor – to transfer its Applicants’ data to any of its Reusable KYC Recipients and (ii) as a Reusable KYC Recipient – to receive, from any of its Reusable KYC Donors, any of the latter’s Applicants’ data; 
  * •the Customer acting as a Reusable KYC Donor additionally warrants that it has a legal basis, under the applicable data protection laws and regulations, permitting the Service Provider to search through the profiles of all Applicants whose personal data is then-currently being processed by the Service Provider on behalf of the Customer via their email addresses or other identifiers and that it has informed its Applicants about such data processing as required by the applicable data protection laws. This search is initiated when an Applicant seeks verification with a Reusable KYC Recipient (in the SDK implementation of the Service) or when a data transfer is requested by a Reusable KYC Recipient (in the API implementation of the Service) and is intended to locate the personal data of the Applicant they may have previously provided to one of the Reusable KYC Donors; 
  * •any transfer of the Applicant’s data between a Reusable KYC Donor and a Reusable KYC Recipient will be carried out by the Service Provider subject to the following conditions: (i) the Dashboard settings for the Reusable KYC Donor and the Reusable KYC Recipient are compatible with the execution of the transfer; (ii) the Applicant’s profile has enough data to fulfill the requirements of the Dashboard configuration of the Reusable KYC Recipient; (iii) specifically and only with regard to the SDK implementation of the Service – the Applicant has made a request, referred to as a "Data Portability Request", to transfer their personal data previously provided to the Reusable KYC Donor for verification with the Reusable KYC Recipient. The Service Provider will implement a technical feature within the System to allow Applicants to submit Data Portability Requests. By acting as a Reusable KYC Donor, the Customer authorizes the Service Provider to process and fulfill any such Data Portability Request submitted by any of the Customer’s Applicants; 
  * •The Service Provider may maintain a data log to record all transfers of data which have been carried out as part of this Service. The data log may include, without limitation, the following data items: timestamp, Reusable KYC Donor’s identity, Reusable KYC Recipient’s identity, Applicant’s ID. 


12.3 The Service Provider may, in its sole discretion, suspend or discontinue the provision of Reusable KYC Service to the Customer (or its respective affiliate, as the case may be) should any of the aforementioned conditions be breached.
12.4 Reusable KYC Service is available in (i) the SDK implementation; (ii) the API implementation; and (iii) a combination of both, to be chosen by the Customer at its own discretion. The Customer acknowledges that a data transfer executed via the API implementation is conducted without real-time authorization of the respective Applicant, which shall not in any way diminish the Customer’s obligations under the applicable data protection laws as set out above.
## Annex 1 – Service Level Agreement
1.1 This Service Level Agreement (“**SLA** ”) is a policy governing the use of the Service Provider’s API and/or SDK (hereinafter “**Sumsub Service** ”) by the Customer.
1.2 Except as otherwise provided herein, this SLA is subject to the Terms and Conditions. Terms not otherwise deﬁned herein shall have the meaning given to them in the Terms and Conditions.
1.3 “Service Availability” means Sumsub Service may be accessed and used by the Customer for the Business Purpose and in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.
1.4 “Uptime Commitment” means the Service Availability shall be at least ninety-nine and five tenths percent (99.5%) in each calendar month.
1.5 Uptime measurement: the Service Provider shall measure uptime by checking the response of Sumsub Service. Every one (1) minute, a third-party service will attempt to access Sumsub Service. If the service does not receive a successful HTTPS response – that is, a HTTPS response code of 2XX or 3XX – that will count as one minute of downtime. The unavailability of Sumsub Service shall be calculated from the time that such unavailability is reported by the Customer to the Service Provider at business-support@sumsub.com.
1.6 Exclusions: The calculation of Uptime Commitment excludes instances of: Force Majeure events, Scheduled Maintenance, or Emergency Maintenance. Scheduled Maintenance means the Service Provider may allocate up to five (5) hours per calendar month to performing maintenance on the System or installing upgrades, fixes or reconfigurations. Emergency Maintenance means the Service Provider may conduct emergency maintenance with no prior notice in order to resolve server security issues or other emergency issues. The Service Provider will use best endeavours to notify the Customer at the beginning and end of such Emergency Maintenance, and will provide details on the nature of the work being performed.
## Annex 2 – Payment Terms
1. Fees
1.1 Subject to the chosen Pricing Plan and the respective Specification, the Customer shall be obliged to pay the Service Provider **Pre-Payment, Commitment, Check Charges, Service Charges, Subscription Fees, and/or Installation Fees** (“**Fees** ”) based on invoices sent by the Service Provider (several invoices may be issued, simultaneously or at different times, in respect of the same reporting period, depending on the exact Fees payable in that reporting period). For the avoidance of doubt, all Fees shall be non-refundable.The Service Provider shall have the right to suspend or limit the Customer’s access to the Services and/or the System: (i) until all payments overdue under the T&C (if any) are received by the Service Provider in full; and/or (ii) as otherwise may be provided under this Annex 2. Where the Service Provider may withdraw any amount payable by the Customer under the T&C from the Customer’s bank account as described below, that amount becomes overdue immediately after:
  * •for cases described under clause 2.3.3, Scenario 2 below – the first unsuccessful (for any reason) attempt of the Service Provider to withdraw it from the Customer’s bank account in full;
  * •regarding the first Commitment payable by the Customer upon the Billing Start Date or upon subscription to a new Pricing Plan, if any – the first unsuccessful (for any reason) attempt of the Service Provider to withdraw it from the Customer’s bank account in full;
  * •in all other cases – the third unsuccessful (for any reason) attempt of the Service Provider to withdraw it from the Customer’s bank account in full.


1.1.1 **Pre-Payment** is paid regularly (upon the Billing Start Date and upon the commencement of each Renewal Period). THE CUSTOMER FULLY ACKNOWLEDGES, ACCEPTS AND AGREES THAT THE PRE-PAYMENT IS NON-CANCELLABLE, NON-REFUNDABLE, AND NON-RECOUPABLE AND PAID ON AN UNCONDITIONAL BASIS (IRRESPECTIVELY OF WHETHER ANY SERVICES WERE RENDERED WITHIN THE INITIAL PERIOD OR THE GIVEN RENEWAL PERIOD, AS THE CASE MAY BE). FOR CLARITY, ONCE THE INITIAL PERIOD OR THE GIVEN RENEWAL PERIOD (AS THE CASE MAY BE) ENDS OR IS TERMINATED, THE UNUSED PART OF THE RESPECTIVE PRE-PAYMENT AUTOMATICALLY EXPIRES AND IS NOT SUBJECT TO REFUND. Notwithstanding this, subject to paying the Pre-Payment, the Customer shall be entitled to use a volume of Checks and/or other Services corresponding to the amount of the Pre-Payment within the Initial Period or the given Renewal Period, as the case may be, such volume to be calculated based on the price of an individual Check / other Services as set out in the chosen Pricing Plan. Once the Pre-Payment is exceeded and until another Pre-Payment is paid, any additional Checks and other Services are billed separately.
Should the Customer fail to pay any Pre-Payment, THE CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE SERVICE PROVIDER MAY, **AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION** , TRANSFER THE CUSTOMER TO ANOTHER PRICING PLAN AND/OR LIMIT OR SUSPEND THE CUSTOMER’S ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM AND/OR THE SERVICES.
1.1.2 **Commitment** is paid regularly (upon the beginning of every reporting period) and on an unconditional basis (irrespectively of whether any Services were rendered within the given reporting period). Once the Commitment is exceeded (as a result of deduction of the other Fees payable and deductible from the Commitment as per the applicable Pricing Plan), any additional Services are billed separately. For clarity, (i) the Commitment is payable even in the absence of the Customer’s usage of any Services; and (ii) once the respective reporting period ends, the unused part of the Commitment automatically expires and is not subject to refunds. Where the Commitment and the Pre-Payment are included in a Pricing Plan simultaneously, the Commitment could be deductible from the Pre-Payment as stated in the respective Pricing Plan.
1.1.2 **Check Charges** and **Service Charges** are paid separately for each Check conducted and for other Services rendered during a reporting period and, by default, are deducted from the Commitment or the Pre-Payment. Where the Customer incurs any Check Charges and/or Service Charges in excess of any given Commitment or Pre-Payment (as the case may be), a separate invoice may be issued by the Service Provider for such additional Fees.
1.1.3 **Subscription Fees** are paid for the provision of specific Services regularly (once in a reporting period) and on an unconditional basis. They are not deductible from the Commitment but may be deductible from the Pre-Payment as indicated in the respective Pricing Plan. For clarity, Subscription Fees are payable even in the absence of the Customer’s usage of the respective Service(s). A separate invoice may be issued by the Service Provider for Subscription Fees payable in any given reporting period.
1.1.4 **Installation Fee** is paid once for the activation of a given Service. The Installation Fee is not deductible from the Commitment but may be deductible from the Pre-Payment as indicated in the respective Pricing Plan.
1.2 **The Fees do not include any applicable taxes, levies, duties, or other similar exactions imposed by a legal, governmental, or regulatory authority in any relevant jurisdiction, including, without limitation, sales, use, value-added, consumption, communications, or withholding taxes. Any amounts of such taxes are not to be deducted by the Customer from amounts payable to the Service Provider. Furthermore, the Fees do not include any charges or commissions imposed by any bank.**
1.3 The Service Provider reserves the right to adjust any Fees payable by the Customer under these Terms and Conditions as follows:
a) provided that any external third-party source engaged by the Service Provider increases an existing charge and/or changes the basis on which it provides information necessary for the provision of any particular Service(s) to the Customer, which results in the Service Provider incurring additional costs in order to keep providing the said Service(s), the Service Provider may, in relation to such Service(s) only, increase the Fees payable under the Agreement by the said additional costs;
b) the Service Provider may additionally, from time to time, adjust any Fees by giving notice to the Customer as set out below, such adjustment to take effect on the date specified in the relevant notice.
**The Service Provider shall notify the Customer of above-mentioned adjustments no later than 15 days prior to the prospective date of their enforcement. In the event that the Customer does not wish to accept the adjustments, the Customer may terminate the Terms and Conditions with immediate effect by giving written notice to the Service Provider**.
1.4. In case of a conflict between this Annex 2 and any applicable Pricing Plan, the latter shall prevail.
**2.3 The Fees shall be charged as follows:**
2.3.1 the **Pre-Payment** , if any, shall be payable by the Customer as reasonably practicable upon the Billing Start Date (or, as the case may be, once the Customer converts to a Pricing Plan including a Pre-Payment) and upon the commencement of any given Renewal Period. The Service Provider may automatically withdraw the corresponding amount from the bank account specified by the Customer at any time (i) after the Customer’s subscription to the respective Pricing Plan; and (ii) for recurring subscriptions – after the beginning of every Renewal Period ;
2.3.2 the Service Provider may automatically withdraw the **Commitment** , if any, from the bank account specified by the Customer: (i) within the first 7 days (on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th or 7th day, at the Service Provider’s discretion) from the Customer’s subscription to the respective Pricing Plan; and (ii) within the first 7 days (on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th or 7th day, at the Service Provider’s discretion) of every following reporting period;
2.3.3 the Service Provider may automatically withdraw **Check Charges and/or Service Charges** incurred in excess of the Commitment (if any) in any given reporting period, and **Subscription Fees** , if any, from the bank account specified by the Customer as follows:
**Scenario 1** - unless the criteria outlined in Scenario 2 are met, withdrawals may only occur within the first 7 days (specifically on the the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th,5th, 6th or 7th day, at the Service Provider’s discretion) of the month following the reporting period;
**Scenario 2:**
  * •withdrawals may occur on any day when the total amount outstanding under the T&C reaches **$3,000 USD**. For clarity, if there are several outstanding amounts equal to or exceeding $3,000 USD each or cumulatively, the Service Provider may attempt to withdraw them separately or simultaneously;
  * •if the total amount outstanding under the T&C reaches **$10,000 USD** and at least one attempt to withdraw it in full from the Customer’s bank account has failed for any reason, the Service Provider can immediately and with no notice suspend the Customer’s access to the Services and the System until the outstanding amount is paid in full (without prejudice to the Service Provider’s right to suspend or limit the Customer’s access to the System and/or the Services as may be elsewise permitted under the T&C).


2.3.4 The Service Provider may automatically withdraw Installation Fees, if any, from the bank account specified by the Customer immediately once the respective Service is activated or at any time thereafter.
2.4. A reporting period shall constitute one calendar month.

The Customer is a Controller which determines the purposes and scope of processing and instructs Sumsub on how to process Personal Data. Specifically, the Customer will provide or make available to Sumsub, the specific purposes, duration and nature of such collection being described in Annex A. The Customer retains control of the Personal Data and remains responsible for compliance with its obligations under the applicable Data Protection Legislation and for the processing instructions it gives to Sumsub, while Sumsub will process Personal Data as described in this Agreement or in the respective instructions and implement appropriate technical and organisational measures as set out in clause 5 of this Agreement. Where applicable, Sumsub is responsible for storing the Applicant’s information, including any Personal Data, tagged with the corresponding risk level by the Customer.

Sumsub warrants that such processing relates to preventing and detecting fraud and other illicit activity as part of substantial public interest, and the Customer hereby authorises such use, including profiling of Personal Data. Even after the Customer’s relationship with Sumsub is terminated, Sumsub may retain the Personal Data and related inferences where it has a lawful basis for doing so, including for purposes of Sumsub’s own legitimate interests of continuing to provide services for all Sumsub customers, complying with its legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing its agreements and serving the (substantial) public interest.
