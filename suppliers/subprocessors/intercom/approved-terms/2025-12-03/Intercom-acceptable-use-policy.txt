## Acceptable Use Policy
Effective day 6 October 2025
(prior version of the AUP available to view [here](https://www.intercom.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy/old))
This Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”) is incorporated into, and forms part of, the Intercom’s Terms of Service or Intercom Master SaaS Subscription Agreement between Customer and Intercom (as applicable, the “Agreement”). Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meaning given to them in the Agreement. This AUP applies to all Customers, Permitted Users and People who use the Services. In the event of a conflict with this AUP and any third-party terms or policies listed in the Additional Product Terms that apply to you when using an Intercom product, this AUP will control to the extent of the conflict.
## General
  1. To keep the Services running safely and smoothly, you agree not to and not to permit or encourage anyone else to: 
    1. use the Services for any illegal or prohibited purpose or in violation of any applicable laws (including without limitation data protection, privacy, artificial intelligence (AI) and export control laws) in connection with using the Services; 
    2. probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network used with the Services; 
    3. tamper with, reverse engineer or hack the Services, circumvent any security or authentication measures of the Services or attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services (or any portion thereof) or related systems, networks or data (including through spoofing or social engineering); 
    4. modify or disable the Services or use the Services in any manner that interferes with or disrupts the integrity or performance of the Services or related systems, network or data; 
    5. access or search the Services by any means other than our publicly supported interfaces; 
    6. copy, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, or disclose any part of the Services in any medium, including without limitation by any automated or non-automated “scraping”; 
    7. access or use the Services in order to monitor its availability, performance, or functionality for competitive purposes; 
    8. overwhelm or attempt to overwhelm our infrastructure by imposing an unreasonably large load on the Services that consume extraordinary resources, such as by: (i) using “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers” or other automated systems to send more request messages to our servers than a human could reasonably send in the same period of time using a normal browser; or (ii) going far beyond the use parameters for any given Service as described in its corresponding documentation; 
    9. use the Services to generate or send unsolicited communications, advertising, phishing or spam, or otherwise cause Intercom to become impaired in its ability to send communications on its own or on its customers’ behalf (e.g., by causing Intercom to become registered on any Email DNS blocked list or otherwise be denied services by any other third party communications service provider); 
    10. misrepresent yourself or disguise the origin of any data, content or other information you submit (including by “spoofing”, “phishing”, manipulating headers or other identifiers, impersonating anyone else, or falsely implying any sponsorship or association with Intercom or any third party) or access the Services via another user’s account without their permission; 
    11. Submit (or post, upload, display, share, instruct to be used or otherwise provide) data, content, fonts or other information, that (i) you don’t have the right to utilize (including confidential or personal information you are not authorized to disclose) or which otherwise infringes Intercom’s or a third party’s intellectual property or other rights; (ii) and/or is deceptive, manipulative, exploitative, fraudulent, bullying, threatening, misleading, illegal, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, harmful to minors, pornographic, indecent, harassing, hateful, violent, encourages illegal or tortious conduct, is religiously, racially or ethnically offensive, or is otherwise inappropriate in Intercom’s discretion; (iii) contains viruses, malware, bots, worms, scripting exploits or other similar materials; or (iv) could otherwise cause damage to Intercom or any third party; 
    12. use meta tags or any other “hidden text” including Intercom’s or our suppliers’ product names or trademarks; or 
    13. engage in any activity that may result in unlawful bias or discrimination of an individual or group of individuals. 


## AI Products:
  1. In addition to the restrictions outlined above that generally apply when using the Services, this section also applies when you are using any AI Product. You agree not to use and not to permit or encourage anyone else to use (including by means of prompting or generating any Output) any AI Products for the following purposes: 
    1. To make or directly facilitate automated decisions that will impact an individual's safety, rights, well-being, or which produces legal effects concerning an individual or similar significant effects concerning an individual; 
    2. To provide any financial, legal, medical or other professional advice or the practice of any occupation subject to licensing requirements under applicable laws; 
    3. In a manner that constitutes use as a medical device or medical device software; 
    4. To provide any illegal gambling, real money gambling, payday lending or sports betting; 
    5. To engage in political or electoral campaigning or lobbying, including generating campaign materials personalized to or targeted to specific demographics; 
    6. Generating or promoting disinformation, misinformation, or other intentionally deceiving or misleading content. 
    7. Any use case which is deemed “high-risk” under applicable AI legislation, including but not limited to use of an AI Product for: biometric identification and classification; emotional recognition; the safety component of critical infrastructure; the safety component of a product; determining access to education and vocational training; recruitment, monitoring or terminating employment of individuals; making a creditworthiness assessment or establishing a credit score; risk assessing or pricing life and health insurance, evaluating eligibility for essential services. 


  1. In addition to the restriction identified in 2(b) in relation to the provision of medical advice, you agree not to use and not to permit or encourage anyone else to use (including by means of prompting or generating any Output) any AI Products in a healthcare setting where the potential inaccuracy of the Output, see 3 (a) below may lead to adverse health related consequences for a natural person. 
    1. As set out in Section 4 of the [AI Product Additional Product Terms](https://www.intercom.com/legal/terms-and-policies/additional-product-terms) Output may contain material inaccuracies and may not reflect correct, current or complete information. Do not rely, or encourage others to rely, on any Output without independently evaluating its accuracy and appropriateness of use, including, without limitation, by using human review. Intercom makes no representations or warranties and provides no indemnities with respect to Output. The AI Products and Output are not intended to substitute for the services of properly trained and licensed individuals. 


## Remedies
A violation of this AUP is a violation of the Agreement. Without affecting any other remedies available to us, Intercom may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend a user’s account or access to the Services without notice or liability if Intercom (in its sole discretion) determines that a user has violated this Acceptable Use Policy.
