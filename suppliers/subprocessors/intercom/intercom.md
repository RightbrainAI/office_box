# Vendor Audit: Intercom

**Original Issue:** [https://github.com/RightbrainAI/office_box/issues/11](https://github.com/RightbrainAI/office_box/issues/11)

---

## 📄 Context & Request

### Supplier Name

Intercom

### Data Processor

Yes

### Minimum Term Length

1 month

### Supplier Site

https://www.intercom.com/

### Internal Contact

Donald "Jared" Dunn (jdunn)

### T&Cs

https://www.intercom.com/legal/terms-and-policies

### Security Documents URL

https://trust.intercom.com/

### Vendor/Service Usage Context

Business Goal: We need to increase our Daily Active Users (DAU) on PiperNet. Currently, our "churn" is catastrophic because users don't understand how to configure their smart fridges to act as nodes.

Usage:

Onboarding Tours: We will use Intercom to guide new users through the "Middle-Out" setup process without them having to read Richard's 40-page whitepaper.

Support Triage: Currently, Richard is personally responding to every bug report with aggression. We need to intercept these messages and route them to a friendly bot or me.

Outbound Messaging: Sending "We miss you" emails to users who haven't contributed storage in 30 days.

Strategic Note: If we don't improve our retention metrics by Q3, the Series B funding from Raviga is at risk. Please prioritize this.



### Data Types Involved

User Email Addresses: (Only for the beta waitlist members).

Device Metadata: IP addresses, device types (e.g., "LG Smart Fridge", "Tesla Console") to help debug node latency.

Support Chat Logs: Free text entered by users.

### How will the supplier be paid?

Company credit card

## 💬 Discussion & Analysis Log

### @github-actions[bot] (2025-12-03T09:56:43Z)
## 🚀 AI-Generated Risk Summary
### **Overall Assessment: Medium**
**Executive Summary:** Intercom presents a **Medium Risk** for this limited use case despite several high-risk contractual terms. While the vendor demonstrates strong security controls (SOC 2, ISO 27001, encryption, MFA), the legal framework is highly unfavorable with California governing law, mandatory arbitration, and critically, a liability cap that would limit recovery to one month's fees in case of a data breach. However, given the narrow scope (1-month beta waitlist with limited PII), the short-term nature of the engagement, and Intercom's mature security posture, the residual risk is acceptable with specific mitigations. **Recommendation: Approve for this 1-month beta only**, but require: (1) formal data deletion request upon termination, (2) legal review before any renewal or expansion, and (3) monitoring of the subprocessor notification list.

### ✅ Positive Findings
* **Comprehensive Security Certifications:** Intercom maintains SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certifications, demonstrating a mature, audited security program that provides strong assurance for protecting our PII.
* **Strong Technical Controls:** 256-bit encryption at rest, TLS 1.2 in transit, mandatory MFA for production access, and monthly vulnerability scanning provide robust technical protection for our user emails and chat data.
* **AI Training Prohibition:** Intercom contractually prohibits their AI subprocessors from using our data for model training, which is critical protection for our proprietary information and user PII.
* **Bug Bounty and Penetration Testing:** The combination of a bug bounty program and annual third-party penetration testing demonstrates proactive security validation beyond standard compliance requirements.

### ⚖️ Key Legal Risks
* **Risk:** Liability Cap Applied to Data Breaches
  * **Summary:** The liability cap is limited to fees paid in the preceding 12 months, which for a 1-month contract would be negligible. Critically, data breaches are NOT excluded from this cap, meaning we would have virtually no financial recourse if Intercom causes a data breach affecting our users' PII.
  * **Recommendation:** Accept for the 1-month beta given limited data scope, but require legal to negotiate unlimited liability for data breaches before any renewal or expansion beyond the initial term.
* **Risk:** California Law and Mandatory Arbitration
  * **Summary:** As a UK entity, being subject to California law and mandatory US arbitration significantly weakens our legal position. Dispute resolution would be costly and complex, with no access to UK/EU courts.
  * **Recommendation:** Document acceptance of this risk for the short-term engagement. For any long-term relationship, negotiate UK or EU governing law with access to local courts.
* **Risk:** 180-Day Automatic Data Retention Post-Termination
  * **Summary:** If we don't explicitly request deletion, Intercom retains our data for 180 days after contract termination, which exceeds typical data minimization principles and our likely internal policies.
  * **Recommendation:** Implement a process to formally request data deletion within 30 days of termination to ensure GDPR compliance and minimize data exposure.

### 🛡️ Key Security Gaps
* **Gap:** Limited Audit Rights with Cost Burden
  * **Summary:** While we can request SOC 2 reports for free, any actual audit would be at our expense (including Intercom's costs), limited to once annually, and subject to Intercom's approval of our auditor. This significantly limits our ability to verify security controls independently.
  * **Recommendation:** Rely on SOC 2 Type II reports for the beta period. Before any expansion, negotiate for annual audit rights at Intercom's expense or shared cost model.
* **Gap:** Subprocessor Notification Requires Manual Subscription
  * **Summary:** We must proactively subscribe to an email list to receive 20-day advance notice of new subprocessors. Without this, we risk missing critical changes to the data processing chain.
  * **Recommendation:** Immediately subscribe to the subprocessor notification list at dataprotection@intercom.io and assign responsibility for monitoring these updates to the Data Protection team.

    "summary": "Audit rights are limited. We can request documentation (e.g., SOC 2 reports) for free. A full audit is possible but at our own expense, including covering Intercom's costs, is limited to once annually, and requires mutual agreement on scope. Intercom can also object to our chosen auditor.",

    "conditions_and_limitations": "Audits are limited to once per year, at our expense (including Intercom's costs), and subject to Intercom's security and confidentiality terms. Intercom can reject our chosen auditor if they are a competitor or not suitably qualified. This significantly limits our practical ability to conduct an independent audit."

Customer may request to Intercom to delete all Customer Personal Data, and Intercom will proceed to delete the data as soon as reasonably practicable and within a maximum period of 30 days from Customer\u2019s written request. If Customer does not request deletion of Customer Personal Data, Intercom will automatically delete it from our systems 180 days after the termination or expiration of this Agreement. Customer Personal Data from our back-up systems will be deleted after 14 days...",
    "comment": "The 30-day deletion timeline upon request is acceptable under GDPR. However, the automatic 180-day retention post-termination is a long period. We must ensure we have a process to formally request deletion within 30 days to comply with our own data retention policies and GDPR principles.",

    "answer": "State of California, U.S.A.",
    "comment": "High risk. As a UK company, being subject to California law and mandatory arbitration in the US is unfavorable. It would be costly and complex to engage in a dispute, and the legal framework is different from the UK/EU standards we operate under. This weakens our legal position significantly.",
